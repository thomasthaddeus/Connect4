# Connect 4

There are numerous enhancements that could be made to this class, depending on the functionality you want. Here are a few ideas:

1. **Improved error handling**: Right now, there is no error checking on the user's input. You could add checks to ensure that the user enters a number, and that the number is in the correct range.

2. **AI Player**: An AI player could be added to the game that uses a simple strategy or even a complex algorithm to determine its next move.

3. **GUI**: You could add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visually appealing and user-friendly.

4. **Game History**: You could add the ability to keep track of past games, including who won, how many moves it took, and even the state of the board at each move.

5. **Player Names**: You could allow the players to enter their names at the start of the game, and use these names when displaying the current player or the winner.

6. **Save / Load Game**: The ability to save a game in progress and load it later could be added.

7. **Game Statistics**: You could keep track of various statistics, like how many games each player has won, how many moves the average game takes, etc.

8. **Game Variations**: You could add variations of the game, like Connect 3 or Connect 5, or allowing the board size to be customized.

9. **Network Play**: You could add the ability for the game to be played over a network, allowing two players on different machines to play against each other.

10. **Refactor Winner Checking**: The current `check_winner` method is a bit complex and could be simplified or broken down into smaller methods to increase readability and maintainability. Also, diagonal checks in both directions should be implemented. Currently, only diagonals from left to right are checked.

## Requirements

1. **Player Input Validation**: The system should validate the player's input, ensuring that it is a numeric value and within the acceptable range (1-7).
2. **Artificial Intelligence Player**: The system should incorporate an AI player which could play against the human player. The AI can follow a simple strategy or a more advanced algorithm.
3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The system should have a GUI to improve user interaction and experience. The GUI should display the game state (board, players, whose turn it is) in a visual manner, and provide interactive ways to make a move.
4. **Game History**: The system should maintain a history of each game played, storing information such as the winner, number of moves, and the state of the board after each move.
5. **Player Names**: The system should provide an option for players to enter their names at the start of the game. The player's names should be used when displaying the current player's turn and the winner of the game.
6. **Save and Load Game**: The system should provide options to save the current game state and to load a previously saved game.
7. **Game Statistics**: The system should keep track of game statistics such as the number of games won by each player, the average number of moves per game, etc.
8. **Game Variations**: The system should allow for game variations such as Connect 3 or Connect 5. It should also provide an option to customize the board size.
9. **Network Play**: The system should support a network mode, enabling two players to play against each other on different machines.
10. **Winner Checking Optimization**: The system should have an optimized and well-structured method to check for the winner, including checking for diagonal connections in both directions.

These requirements describe what the enhanced Connect 4 system should do, from the perspective of the end user. Implementing them would require planning, design, and testing to ensure that they are met successfully and that the system performs as expected.

The file structure for a project like this can be very flexible depending on the scope of the project and how much you want to separate concerns.

Here's a basic structure you might start with if you're planning to implement all of the features:

```bash
/connect4/
|-- main/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- main.py
|   |-- board.py
|   |-- player.py
|   |-- AI.py
|   |-- network.py
|-- gui/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- window.py
|-- data/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- game_history.py
|   |-- game_statistics.py
|   |-- save_load.py
|-- tests/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- test_main.py
|   |-- test_board.py
|   |-- test_player.py
|   |-- test_AI.py
|   |-- test_network.py
|   |-- test_game_history.py
|   |-- test_game_statistics.py
|   |-- test_save_load.py

```

Here's what each file could be responsible for:

- `main.py`: Starts the game, responsible for the main game loop and orchestrating the other components.
- `board.py`: Contains the `Connect4` class, which is responsible for maintaining the game board and checking for a winner.
- `player.py`: Defines a `Player` class, which could store information about each player, like their name and number of wins.
- `AI.py`: Defines the AI player's logic.
- `network.py`: Responsible for the network play feature.
- `gui/window.py`: Contains the GUI code.
- `data/game_history.py`: Manages the game history feature.
- `data/game_statistics.py`: Manages the game statistics feature.
- `data/save_load.py`: Manages saving and loading game states.
- `tests/test_*.py`: Contains unit tests for each component.

This is just a starting point. As the project evolves, you might find that you want to add additional modules, combine some of these modules, or break them down even further. The most important thing is to keep the structure organized and understandable.
