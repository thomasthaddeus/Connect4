# TODO: List

Certainly! Let's break down the provided code and identify what's unfinished or needs connections:

### 1. **Game Backend (`main.py`)**

- **`make_move(self, row, col)`**: This function is a placeholder and needs the logic to make a move on the board.
- **`end_game(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to handle the end of a game.
- **`save_game(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to save the current game state.
- **`load_game(self, filename)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to load a saved game state.
- **`update_statistics(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to update game statistics.
- **`record_game(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to record game history.

### 2. **GUI (`app.py` and individual window files)**

- **`MainMenuWindow`**:
  - **`play_against_ai(self)`**: Opens the `PlayerSetupWindow` but doesn't handle the actual game setup.
  - **`multiplayer(self)`**: Opens the `NetworkSetupWindow` but doesn't handle the actual network setup.
  - **`view_game_stats(self)`** and **`view_game_history(self)`**: These methods currently assume empty data. They need to be connected to the backend to fetch actual game statistics and history.

- **`GameOverWindow`**:
  - **`play_again(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to reset the game or signal the main window to start a new game.
  - **`main_menu(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to return to the main menu or close the current window.

- **`GameStatisticsWindow`**:
  - **`main_menu(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to return to the main menu or close the current window.

- **`GameWindow`**:
  - **`drop_piece(self, row, col)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to handle dropping a piece onto the board.
  - **`end_game(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to handle ending the game and possibly opening the `GameOverWindow`.

- **`PlayerSetupWindow`**:
  - **`start_game(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to start the game.

- **`GameHistoryWindow`**:
  - **`view_details(self)`**: Placeholder function that needs logic to view game details.

- **`NetworkSetupWindow`**:
  - **`start_or_connect(self)`**: This function currently only shows message boxes. It needs to be connected to the backend to handle actual network operations.

### 3. **Data Classes**

- **`GameStatistics`**: This class seems mostly complete, but you might want to add more methods if you need specific statistics.
- **`SaveLoad`**: The methods in this class are complete, but you'll need to ensure they're properly integrated with the game's state and the GUI.
- **`GameHistory`**: This class seems mostly complete, but you might want to add more methods if you need specific history-related functionalities.

### 4. **Connections**:

- The `app.py` file has placeholders for connecting signals/slots between the GUI and the backend. These need to be fleshed out. For example, when a button is clicked in the GUI, it should trigger a corresponding method in the backend.

### Recommendations:

1. **Error Handling**: Many functions have basic error handling (like printing an error message). Consider using more advanced error handling, possibly with custom exceptions.
2. **Integration**: Ensure that the GUI and the backend (`main.py`) are well-integrated. This means that actions in the GUI should reflect in the game's state and vice versa.
3. **Testing**: Once the implementation is more complete, consider writing tests to ensure everything works as expected.

In summary, while the structure and many of the classes are in place, there's a significant amount of integration and implementation work left to do to make the game fully functional.
