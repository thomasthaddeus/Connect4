# Connect Four

This repository contains the program for a python implementation of a connect 4 game

## TODO

### 1. **Completed**

- GUI Layouts for:
  - Main Menu
  - Game Over Window
  - Game Statistics Window
  - Player Setup Window
  - Game History Window
  - Network Setup Window
  - Game Window
- A Return to Main Menu Widget
- A basic outline of the network setup logic.
- A basic interaction between the front-end (GUI) and a hypothetical back-end game logic.

### 2. **Not Implemented / Needs Consideration**

- **Backend Game Logic**:
  - Actual game rules for Connect 4 (winning conditions, draw conditions).
  - Logic for AI player (e.g., the Minimax algorithm).
  - Handling multiplayer games, especially over the network.
  - Saving and loading game states.
  - Tracking and updating game statistics and history.
- **Network Functionality**:
  - Actual networking logic for hosting and joining games.
  - Handling communication between two game instances over the network.
- **Database or Storage**:
  - A system to store game history, player statistics, saved game states, etc.
- **Art and Graphics**:
  - Visual assets for the game board, pieces, background, etc.
  - Animations (like a piece falling) for improved user experience.
- **Sound Effects and Music**:
  - Background music or sound effects for gameplay actions (like dropping a piece).
- **AI Player**:
  - Developing and integrating an AI player. While we discussed the Minimax algorithm, the actual AI implementation and its integration with the game logic are still pending.
- **Error Handling and Robustness**:
  - Ensuring that the game handles unexpected situations gracefully.
  - Validations, especially in network settings (e.g., valid IP address, port number).
- **Testing**:
  - Both unit tests (for individual components/functions) and integration tests (for the whole game) need to be considered.
- **Documentation**:
  - Commenting the code, writing user manuals, or developer documentation if needed.
